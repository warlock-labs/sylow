    "# A Comprehensive Guide to ZK and MPC on Ethereum using BLS and BN254\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with fundamental concepts in set theory, group theory, and ring theory. These will provide the basis for understanding more advanced structures like fields and vector spaces. Number theory and Euclidean domains will be introduced to provide essential tools for cryptographic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we progress, we'll delve into algebraic varieties and elliptic curves, which are crucial for understanding the BN254 curve. We'll then explore bilinear pairings, which are fundamental to the BLS signature scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll apply these concepts to the specific case of the BN254 curve and the BLS signature scheme, culminating in an exploration of threshold signatures, R1CS, and distributed multi-party computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this primer, readers will have a solid grasp of the mathematical concepts necessary to understand and implement BLS threshold signatures using the BN254 pairing. This knowledge is crucial for developing secure and efficient cryptographic protocols in various applications, including blockchain technology and distributed systems.\n",

    "## Set Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Set theory forms the bedrock of modern mathematics. It provides us with a language to discuss collections of objects and the \n",
    "relationships between them. For a more in-depth treatment of set theory, Halmos' \"Naive Set Theory\" and Suppes' \"Axiomatic Set Theory\" \n",
    "are superb resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set is a collection of distinct objects, called elements or members of the set.\n",
    "2. If $a$ is an element of set $A$, we write $a \\in A$.\n",
    "3. The empty set, denoted $\\varnothing$, is the unique set with no elements.\n",
    "4. A set $A$ is a subset of set $B$, denoted $A \\subseteq B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.\n",
    "5. Every set $A \\subseteq A$, or in other words, every set is contained by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Set theory defines several operations on sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Union: $A \\cup B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B\\}$\n",
    "   The union of two sets contains all elements that are in either set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Intersection: $A \\cap B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}$\n",
    "   The intersection contains all elements common to both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Difference: $A \\setminus B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\notin B\\}$\n",
    "   The difference contains elements in $A$ but not in $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Symmetric Difference: $A \\triangle B = (A \\setminus B) \\cup (B \\setminus A)$\n",
    "   This operation results in elements that are in either set, but not in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cartesian Product\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cartesian product of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \\times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs where the first element comes \n",
    "from $A$ and the second from $B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\times B = \\{(a,b) : a \\in A \\text{ and } b \\in B\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function $f$ from set $A$ to set $B$, denoted $f: A \\to B$, is a rule that assigns to each element of $A$ exactly one element of $B$. \n",
    "We call $A$ the domain and $B$ the codomain of $f$. The set of all $f(a)$ for $a \\in A$ is called the range of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can have special properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Injective (one-to-one): $\\forall a_1, a_2 \\in A, f(a_1) = f(a_2) \\implies a_1 = a_2$\n",
    "2. Surjective (onto): $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists a \\in A : f(a) = b$\n",
    "3. Bijective: Both injective and surjective\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cardinality\n",
    "\n",
    "The cardinality of a set $A$, denoted $|A|$, is the number of elements in $A$ if $A$ is finite. For infinite sets, cardinality \n",
    "becomes more complex:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Countably infinite: A set with the same cardinality as the natural numbers, denoted $\\aleph_0$.\n",
    "- Uncountable: An infinite set that is not countably infinite, such as the real numbers, with cardinality denoted $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Group Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Group theory is the study of symmetries and algebraic structures. Professor Macauley's Visual Group Theory lectures on YouTube \n",
    "and Nathan Carter's \"Visual Group Theory\" book provide a beautiful and approachable exposition. Saracino's \"Abstract Algebra\" \n",
    "is approachable but in need of fresh typesetting. Lang's \"Algebra\" is also a good resource here and more generally on rings and \n",
    "fields to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "A group is an ordered pair $(\\mathbb{G}, *)$ where $\\mathbb{G}$ is a set and $*$ is a binary operation on $\\mathbb{G}$ satisfying \n",
    "four axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Closure: $\\forall a, b \\in \\mathbb{G}, a * b \\in \\mathbb{G}$\n",
    "2. Associativity: $\\forall a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{G}, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$\n",
    "3. Identity: $\\exists e \\in \\mathbb{G}, \\forall a \\in \\mathbb{G}: a * e = e * a = a$\n",
    "4. Inverse: $\\forall a \\in \\mathbb{G}, \\exists a^{-1} \\in \\mathbb{G}: a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = e$\n",
    "\n",
    "The identity element is often denoted as $e$, and the inverse of an element $a$ is written as $a^{-1}$. We also have \"subtraction\" defined through the binary operator of the inverse of an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abelian Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "An Abelian group, named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, is a group which is commutative under the binary operation $*$. A group $\\mathbb{G}$ is abelian if $a * b = b * a, \\forall a, b \\in \\mathbb{G}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finite Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "A group $\\mathbb{G}$ is finite if the number of elements in $\\mathbb{G}$ is finite, which then has cardinality or order $|\\mathbb{G}|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lagrange's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "For a finite group $\\mathbb{G}$ with $a \\in \\mathbb{G}$ and let there exist a positive integer $d$ such that $a^d$ is the smallest positive power of $a$ that is equal to $e$, the identity of the group. Let $n = |\\mathbb{G}|$ be the order of $\\mathbb{G}$, and let $d$ be the order of $a$, then $a^n = e$ and $d \\mid n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "A subset $H$ of a group $\\mathbb{G}$ is a subgroup if it forms a group under the same operation as $\\mathbb{G}$. We denote this as $H \\leq \\mathbb{G}$. The order of a subgroup always divides the order of the group (Lagrange's Theorem). Similar to a set, every group $\\mathbb{G} \\subseteq \\mathbb{G}$, and for every group there is a trivial subgroup containing only the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms\n",
    "\n",
    "A function $f: G \\to H$ between groups is a homomorphism if it preserves the group operation: $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) \\forall a,b \\in G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An isomorphism is a bijective homomorphism. If there exists an isomorphism between groups $G$ and $H$, we say they are isomorphic and write $G \\cong H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cosets and Normal Subgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "For a subgroup $H$ of $G$ and an element $a \\in G$, we define:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Left coset: $aH = \\{ah : h \\in H\\}$\n",
    "- Right coset: $Ha = \\{ha : h \\in H\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A subgroup $N$ of $G$ is called normal if $gN = Ng \\forall g \\in G$. We denote this as $$N \\triangleleft G$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cyclic Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "A group $\\mathbb{G}$ is cyclic if there exists an element $g \\in \\mathbb{G}$ such that every element of $\\mathbb{G}$ can be written as a power of $g$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{G} = \\langle g \\rangle = \\{g^n : n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $g$ is called a generator of $\\mathbb{G}$. Cyclic groups have several important properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every element $x \\in \\mathbb{G}$ can be written as $x = g^n$ for some integer $n$.\n",
    "2. If $\\mathbb{G}$ is infinite, it is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}, +)$.\n",
    "3. If $\\mathbb{G}$ is finite with $|\\mathbb{G}| = n$, it is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}, +)$.\n",
    "4. All cyclic groups are Abelian.\n",
    "5. Subgroups of cyclic groups are cyclic.\n",
    "6. The order of $\\mathbb{G}$ is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $g^m = e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quotient Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "If $N \\triangleleft G$, we can form the quotient group $G/N$, whose elements are the cosets of $N$ in $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ring Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "A ring $(R, +, \\cdot)$ is an algebraic structure consisting of a set $R$ with two binary operations, addition $(+)$ and multiplication $(\\cdot)$, satisfying the following axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $(R, +)$ is an abelian group:\n",
    "   - Closure: $\\forall a, b \\in R, a + b \\in R$\n",
    "   - Associativity: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$\n",
    "   - Commutativity: $\\forall a, b \\in R, a + b = b + a$\n",
    "   - Identity: $\\exists 0 \\in R, \\forall a \\in R, a + 0 = 0 + a = a$\n",
    "   - Inverse: $\\forall a \\in R, \\exists (-a) \\in R, a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $(R, \\cdot)$ is a monoid:\n",
    "   - Closure: $\\forall a, b \\in R, a \\cdot b \\in R$\n",
    "   - Associativity: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R, (a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distributivity:\n",
    "   - Left distributivity: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R, a \\cdot (b + c) = (a \\cdot b) + (a \\cdot c)$\n",
    "   - Right distributivity: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R, (a + b) \\cdot c = (a \\cdot c) + (b \\cdot c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "A ring is called commutative if multiplication is commutative, i.e., $\\forall a, b \\in R, a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a$. If a ring has a multiplicative identity element $1 \\neq 0$ such that $\\forall a \\in R, 1 \\cdot a = a \\cdot 1 = a$, it is called a ring with unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideals\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal of a ring $R$ is a subset $I \\subseteq R$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $(I,+)$ is a subgroup of $(R,+)$, meaning:\n",
    "   a. $I$ is non-empty\n",
    "   b. For all $a,b \\in I$, $a - b \\in I$\n",
    "2. For all $r \\in R$ and $i \\in I$, both $r \\cdot i \\in I$ and $i \\cdot r \\in I$ (absorption property)\n",
    "\n",
    "The absorption property of ideals interacts with both ring operations, as it involves multiplication by any ring element and the result remains in the ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quotient Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "For a ring $R$ and ideal $I$, the quotient ring $R/I$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R/I = \\{r + I : r \\in R\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r + I = \\{r + i : i \\in I\\}$ is the coset of $r$ modulo $I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations in $R/I$ are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Addition: $(a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I$\n",
    "2. Multiplication: $(a + I) \\cdot (b + I) = (a \\cdot b) + I$\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are well-defined because of the ideal properties, particularly the absorption property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polynomial Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a ring $R$, the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is defined as the set of all formal sums of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ... + a_nx^n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $n \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$\n",
    "2. $a_i \\in R$ (called coefficients)\n",
    "3. $x$ is an indeterminate (or variable)\n",
    "4. Only finitely many $a_i$ are non-zero\n",
    "\n",
    "The ring structure of $R[x]$ is defined by the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Addition: For $f(x) = \\sum a_ix^i$ and $g(x) = \\sum b_ix^i$,\n",
    "\n",
    "   $(f + g)(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\max(\\deg(f),\\deg(g))} (a_i + b_i)x^i$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiplication: For $f(x) = \\sum a_ix^i$$ and $$g(x) = \\sum b_ix^i$,\n",
    "\n",
    "   $(f \\cdot g)(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\deg(f)+\\deg(g)} (\\sum_{i+j=k} a_ib_j)x^k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The zero polynomial, denoted $0$, has all coefficients equal to $0$.\n",
    "2. If $R$ has a unity $1 \\neq 0$, then $R[x]$ has a unity, which is the constant polynomial $1$.\n",
    "3. $R$ is embedded in $R[x]$ as the set of constant polynomials.\n",
    "4. If $R$ is commutative, then $R[x]$ is commutative.\n",
    "5. The degree of a non-zero polynomial $f(x)$, denoted $\\deg(f)$, is the highest power of $x$ with a non-zero coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition treats polynomials as formal algebraic objects, not as functions. The construction can be extended to multiple variables, e.g., $R[x,y] = (R[x])[y]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prime Numbers and Divisibility\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely represented as a product of prime powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For integers $a$ and $b$, we say $a$ divides $b$ (denoted $a \\mid b$) if there exists an integer $k$ such that $b = ak$. If $a \\mid b$ and $a \\mid c$, then $a \\mid (bx + cy)$ for any integers $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)\n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest common divisor of two integers $a$ and $b$, denoted $\\gcd(a,b)$, is the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and $b$. Key properties include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(|a|,|b|)$\n",
    "2. $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(b, a \\bmod b)$ (basis for the Euclidean algorithm)\n",
    "3. There exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $\\gcd(a,b) = ax + by$ (Bézout's identity)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integral Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity that has no zero divisors. In other words, for all non-zero elements $a, b \\in R$, if $a \\cdot b = 0$, then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. This property is crucial as it allows for cancellation in multiplication: if $a \\cdot b = a \\cdot c$ and $a \\neq 0$, then $b = c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclidean Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "A Euclidean domain is an integral domain $R$ equipped with a function $\\delta: R \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}$ (called the Euclidean function) satisfying:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For all non-zero $a, b \\in R$, $\\delta(a) \\leq \\delta(ab)$\n",
    "2. For all $a, b \\in R$ with $b \\neq 0$, there exist $q, r \\in R$ such that $a = bq + r$ and either $r = 0$ or $\\delta(r) < \\delta(b)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second property is known as the Euclidean division algorithm, which is a generalization of the division algorithm for integers. This algorithm allows us to perform division with remainders in the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Euclidean Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ with $\\delta(a) = |a|$\n",
    "2. The polynomial ring $F[x]$ over a field $F$ with $\\delta(p) = \\deg(p)$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Euclidean Division Algorithm\n",
    "\n",

    "            r = r - b\n",
    "    return (q, r)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In $\\mathbb{Z}_5$, we're primarily concerned with the remainder $r$, which will always be in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extended Euclidean Division\n",
    "\n",
    "The extended Euclidean Division is a way to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers $a$ and $b$, and also find the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which states that:\n",
