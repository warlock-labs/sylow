    "There are a lot of good partial implementations of everything in this document. my recommendation is to start with [seda's barebones of bn254](https://github.com/sedaprotocol/bn254) and the [pairing library here](https://github.com/paritytech/bn) to create our skeleton. These two libraries have minimal external dependencies, and are lightwight renditions of the functionality. We then take the thresholding logic of [threshold_bls](https://github.com/ARPA-Network/BLS-TSS-Network/tree/75da9ae432516002b12e37b16b4a4b3568c79529/crates/threshold-bls) for the  partial signature generation and aggregation, etc. (all of its curve logic is imported from external crates so I don't recommend starting off with this).\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest issue in these existing repos is the security concerns regarding the `hash_to_field` and `field_to_curve` functions, which are only implemented with naÃ¯ve algorithms in these repos. Fortunately, there is a clear guide to developing secure elliptic curve suites created by cloudflare called [RFC 9380](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9380) which specifies very clearly, with example algorithms, references, and precise language, how to remedy these issues, and what algorithms to use for which curves, security levels, etc.\n",

    "There are implementations by [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra/tree/master/curves/bn254) and [zkcrypto/bls12_381](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381/tree/main). Arkworks unfortunately is extermely bloated and very massive for something that only provides the elliptic curve logic, and zkcrpto/bls12_381 is the wrong curve. However,  arkworks is a good reference for our friendly bn254, and zkcrypto/bls12_381 conforms to security standards set out in RFC9380, so they should be good references while we build our product.\n",
