I mean, there are issues with the $\\mathbb{G}_2$ cofactor clearing to create elements in $\\mathbb{G}_2$ from the field because of the size of the cofactor, so if multiplication is slow, exponentiation is not guaranteed to be better *a priori*. \n",

    "Up until this point, we were precise in our definitions of $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\\mathbb{G}_2$, but have been unclear about what exactly the target group of the pairing should be. We now formally define the target group $\\mathbb{G}_T$ to be the group of $r$-th roots of unity over the multipicative group $\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^\\ast=(\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}/ \\{0\\}, \\ast)$, denoted commonly by $\\mu_r$. Why the roots o f unity? Great question. Remember that this mapping has to satisfy a few key real-world properties. First, it has to be a trapdoor, namely preimage resistance (assuming DL hardness), and mapping backwards from the roots of unity is a very difficult problem. Second, it allows for an easy metric against which we can compare two mappings. For example, in the case of signature verification $e(\\sigma_i, g_2)=e(H(m), P(i))$, it is very natural to want to set the actual value of each side of this equation to \"one\", therefore implying the image domain to be the roots of unity. Note that this implies right away that $|\\mathbb{G}_1|=|\\mathbb{G}_2|=|\\mathbb{G}_T|=r$, which makes the pairing retain the correct group structure while still mapping to a cryptographically secure image, aka a group of \"ones\".\n",

We can then define the quotient group $\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^\\ast / (\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^\\ast)^r$ which represent the coset of $r$ powers, namely each element in this quotient group differ by a power of $r$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\forall x\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^\\ast$, $\\left(x^{\\frac{p^k-1}{r}}\\right)^r = x^{p^k-1} = 1$, which means elements of the form $x^{\\frac{p^k-1}{r}}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p}^\\ast / (\\mathbb{F}_{p}^\\ast)^r$, which is precisely what the pairing function $e$ does. There is a natural isomorphism between the quotient group and the roots of unity, so we can equivalently talk about either. For the purposes of the following, however, we'll keep to the quotient group representation since it admits a few additional insights we can use to our advantage. \n",

To do this, we define what's called the cyclotomic polynomial, defined by an order $n$. This polynomial contains all of the irreducible factors of $x^n-1$ (which defines the roots of unity), and is therefore the polynomial whose roots are the roots of unity. In this sense, this polynomial captures all of the structure of the roots of unity, and because of its irreducibility, we can use it to build other mappings that deal with the group of roots of unity.\n",

The easy part will involve something like $x^{p^6-1}=x^{p^6}\\cdot x^{-1}$, which is one conjugation, one inversion, and one multiplication (remember that conjugation in $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$ for an element $x=a+bw$ is simply $\\bar{x}=a-bw$).
