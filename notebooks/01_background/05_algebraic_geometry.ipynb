    "## Vector Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector spaces are fundamental algebraic structures that generalize the notion of vectors in two or three-dimensional space to any number of dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Vector Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is a set equipped with two operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vector addition: $+: V \\times V \\to V$\n",
    "2. Scalar multiplication: $\\cdot: F \\times V \\to V$\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations must satisfy the following axioms for all $u, v, w \\in V$ and $a, b \\in F$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)$ (Associativity of addition)\n",
    "2. $u + v = v + u$ (Commutativity of addition)\n",
    "3. $\\exists 0 \\in V$ such that $v + 0 = v$ for all $v \\in V$ (Additive identity)\n",
    "4. For each $v \\in V$, $\\exists (-v) \\in V$ such that $v + (-v) = 0$ (Additive inverse)\n",
    "5. $a(u + v) = au + av$ (Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition)\n",
    "6. $(a + b)v = av + bv$ (Distributivity of scalar multiplication over field addition)\n",
    "7. $(ab)v = a(bv)$ (Associativity of scalar multiplication)\n",
    "8. $1v = v$ where $1$ is the multiplicative identity in $F$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Independence and Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of vectors $\\{v_1, \\ldots, v_n\\}$ in a vector space $V$ is linearly independent if the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \\cdots + a_nv_n = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "implies $a_1 = a_2 = \\cdots = a_n = 0$ for scalars $a_i \\in F$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basis for a vector space $V$ is a linearly independent set of vectors that spans $V$. In other words, every vector in $V$ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension and Subspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension of a vector space $V$, denoted $\\dim(V)$, is the number of vectors in any basis of $V$. A finite-dimensional vector space has a finite basis, while an infinite-dimensional space does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subspace $W$ of a vector space $V$ is a subset of $V$ that is itself a vector space under the operations inherited from $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concrete Example: Vector Space over $\\mathbb{Z}_5$\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these concepts, let's consider a concrete example using the finite field $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ (integers modulo 5). We'll explore the vector space $V = \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$, which consists of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5$. Our scalar field is $\\mathbb{Z}_5 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vector Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "For $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \\in V$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(a_1, b_1) + (a_2, b_2) = ((a_1 + a_2) \\bmod 5, (b_1 + b_2) \\bmod 5)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "$$(2, 3) + (4, 1) = (1, 4)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scalar Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "For $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5$ and $(a, b) \\in V$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c \\cdot (a, b) = ((ca) \\bmod 5, (cb) \\bmod 5)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "$$3 \\cdot (2, 4) = (1, 2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verifying Vector Space Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's verify some of the vector space axioms using our $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$ example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Commutativity of addition:**\n",
    "   $$(2, 3) + (4, 1) = (1, 4) = (4, 1) + (2, 3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Associativity of addition:**\n",
    "   $$((2, 3) + (4, 1)) + (3, 2) = (1, 4) + (3, 2) = (4, 1)$$\n",
    "   $$(2, 3) + ((4, 1) + (3, 2)) = (2, 3) + (2, 3) = (4, 1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Additive identity:**\n",
    "   The zero vector is $(0, 0)$\n",
    "   $$(2, 3) + (0, 0) = (2, 3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Additive inverse:**\n",
    "   For $(2, 3)$, the additive inverse is $(3, 2)$\n",
    "   $$(2, 3) + (3, 2) = (0, 0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition:**\n",
    "   $$3 \\cdot ((2, 1) + (4, 3)) = 3 \\cdot (1, 4) = (3, 2)$$\n",
    "   $$3 \\cdot (2, 1) + 3 \\cdot (4, 3) = (1, 3) + (2, 4) = (3, 2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Independence and Basis in $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$\n",
    "\n",
    "In $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$, the vectors $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$ form a basis. They are linearly independent because:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a(1, 0) + b(0, 1) = (0, 0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "implies $a = b = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every vector in $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(a, b) = a(1, 0) + b(0, 1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subspaces of $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of subspaces in $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$ include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\{(0, 0)\\}$: The trivial subspace\n",
    "2. $\\{(a, 0) \\mid a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_5\\}$: A one-dimensional subspace\n",
    "3. $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$ itself: The entire space\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dimension of $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension of $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$ is 2, as it has a basis with two vectors. This means that any set of three or more vectors in $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$ must be linearly dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algebraic Varieties\n",
    "\n",
    "Algebraic varieties are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry, providing a geometric perspective on solutions to systems of polynomial equations. We'll explore their definition, types, and key properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Algebraic Varieties\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, and let $k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]$ be the ring of polynomials in $n$ variables over $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 1 (Affine Algebraic Set):** For a set of polynomials $S \\subset k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]$, we define the affine algebraic set $V(S)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(S) = \\{(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) \\in k^n : f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = 0 \\text{ for all } f \\in S\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2 (Algebraic Variety):** An algebraic variety is an irreducible algebraic set. That is, it cannot be written as the union of two proper algebraic subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any subset $X \\subset k^n$, we define the ideal of $X$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(X) = \\{f \\in k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n] : f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = 0 \\text{ for all } (a_1, \\ldots, a_n) \\in X\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 1 (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz):** For any ideal $I \\subset k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(V(I)) = \\sqrt{I}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sqrt{I}$ is the radical of $I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem establishes a fundamental correspondence between algebraic sets and radical ideals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Affine and Projective Varieties\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Affine Varieties\n",
    "\n",
    "An affine variety is an algebraic variety in affine space $k^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** The parabola $y = x^2$ in $k^2$ is an affine variety defined by the polynomial $f(x,y) = y - x^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Projective Varieties\n",
    "\n",
    "To define projective varieties, we first introduce projective space:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3 (Projective Space):** The projective $n$-space over $k$, denoted $\\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ or simply $\\mathbb{P}^n$, is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{P}^n = (k^{n+1} \\setminus \\{0\\}) / \\sim$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sim$ is the equivalence relation $(x_0, \\ldots, x_n) \\sim (\\lambda x_0, \\ldots, \\lambda x_n)$ for any $\\lambda \\in k^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A projective variety is an algebraic variety in projective space $\\mathbb{P}^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 4 (Projective Variety):** For a set of homogeneous polynomials $S \\subset k[x_0, \\ldots, x_n]$, we define the projective algebraic set $V(S)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(S) = \\{[a_0 : \\ldots : a_n] \\in \\mathbb{P}^n : f(a_0, \\ldots, a_n) = 0 \\text{ for all } f \\in S\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A projective variety is an irreducible projective algebraic set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** The projective conic $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is a projective variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinate ring of an algebraic variety encodes its algebraic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 5 (Coordinate Ring):** For an affine variety $X \\subset k^n$, the coordinate ring of $X$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k[X] = k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n] / I(X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a projective variety $X \\subset \\mathbb{P}^n$, we define the homogeneous coordinate ring as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S(X) = k[x_0, \\ldots, x_n] / I(X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I(X)$ is the homogeneous ideal of polynomials vanishing on $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Algebraic Varieties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dimension:** The dimension of an algebraic variety $X$ is defined as the transcendence degree of its function field $k(X)$ over $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Singular Points:** A point $p$ on a variety $X$ is singular if the rank of the Jacobian matrix at $p$ is less than the dimension of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zariski Topology:** The Zariski topology on $k^n$ or $\\mathbb{P}^n$ is defined by taking algebraic sets as closed sets. This topology is fundamental in algebraic geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Morphisms:** A morphism between varieties $X \\subset k^m$ and $Y \\subset k^n$ is a function $\\phi: X \\to Y$ such that each component is given by a polynomial function."
