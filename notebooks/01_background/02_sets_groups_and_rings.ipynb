    "## Set Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Set theory forms the bedrock of modern mathematics. It provides us with a language to discuss collections of objects and the \n",
    "relationships between them. For a more in-depth treatment of set theory, Halmos' \"Naive Set Theory\" and Suppes' \"Axiomatic Set Theory\" \n",
    "are superb resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set is a collection of distinct objects, called elements or members of the set.\n",
    "2. If $a$ is an element of set $A$, we write $a \\in A$.\n",
    "3. The empty set, denoted $\\varnothing$, is the unique set with no elements.\n",
    "4. A set $A$ is a subset of set $B$, denoted $A \\subseteq B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.\n",
    "5. Every set $A \\subseteq A$, or in other words, every set is contained by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Set theory defines several operations on sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Union: $A \\cup B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B\\}$\n",
    "   The union of two sets contains all elements that are in either set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Intersection: $A \\cap B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}$\n",
    "   The intersection contains all elements common to both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Difference: $A \\setminus B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\notin B\\}$\n",
    "   The difference contains elements in $A$ but not in $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Symmetric Difference: $A \\triangle B = (A \\setminus B) \\cup (B \\setminus A)$\n",
    "   This operation results in elements that are in either set, but not in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cartesian Product\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cartesian product of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \\times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs where the first element comes \n",
    "from $A$ and the second from $B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A \\times B = \\{(a,b) : a \\in A \\text{ and } b \\in B\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function $f$ from set $A$ to set $B$, denoted $f: A \\to B$, is a rule that assigns to each element of $A$ exactly one element of $B$. \n",
    "We call $A$ the domain and $B$ the codomain of $f$. The set of all $f(a)$ for $a \\in A$ is called the range of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can have special properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Injective (one-to-one): $\\forall a_1, a_2 \\in A, f(a_1) = f(a_2) \\implies a_1 = a_2$\n",
    "2. Surjective (onto): $\\forall b \\in B, \\exists a \\in A : f(a) = b$\n",
    "3. Bijective: Both injective and surjective\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cardinality\n",
    "\n",
    "The cardinality of a set $A$, denoted $|A|$, is the number of elements in $A$ if $A$ is finite. For infinite sets, cardinality \n",
    "becomes more complex:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Countably infinite: A set with the same cardinality as the natural numbers, denoted $\\aleph_0$.\n",
    "- Uncountable: An infinite set that is not countably infinite, such as the real numbers, with cardinality denoted $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Group Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Group theory is the study of symmetries and algebraic structures. Professor Macauley's Visual Group Theory lectures on YouTube \n",
    "and Nathan Carter's \"Visual Group Theory\" book provide a beautiful and approachable exposition. Saracino's \"Abstract Algebra\" \n",
    "is approachable but in need of fresh typesetting. Lang's \"Algebra\" is also a good resource here and more generally on rings and \n",
    "fields to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "A group is an ordered pair $(\\mathbb{G}, *)$ where $\\mathbb{G}$ is a set and $*$ is a binary operation on $\\mathbb{G}$ satisfying \n",
    "four axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Closure: $\\forall a, b \\in \\mathbb{G}, a * b \\in \\mathbb{G}$\n",
    "2. Associativity: $\\forall a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{G}, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$\n",
    "3. Identity: $\\exists e \\in \\mathbb{G}, \\forall a \\in \\mathbb{G}: a * e = e * a = a$\n",
    "4. Inverse: $\\forall a \\in \\mathbb{G}, \\exists a^{-1} \\in \\mathbb{G}: a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = e$\n",
    "\n",
    "The identity element is often denoted as $e$, and the inverse of an element $a$ is written as $a^{-1}$. We also have \"subtraction\" defined through the binary operator of the inverse of an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abelian Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "An Abelian group, named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, is a group which is commutative under the binary operation $*$. A group $\\mathbb{G}$ is abelian if $a * b = b * a, \\forall a, b \\in \\mathbb{G}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finite Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "A group $\\mathbb{G}$ is finite if the number of elements in $\\mathbb{G}$ is finite, which then has cardinality or order $|\\mathbb{G}|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lagrange's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "For a finite group $\\mathbb{G}$ with $a \\in \\mathbb{G}$ and let there exist a positive integer $d$ such that $a^d$ is the smallest positive power of $a$ that is equal to $e$, the identity of the group. Let $n = |\\mathbb{G}|$ be the order of $\\mathbb{G}$, and let $d$ be the order of $a$, then $a^n = e$ and $d \\mid n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "A subset $H$ of a group $\\mathbb{G}$ is a subgroup if it forms a group under the same operation as $\\mathbb{G}$. We denote this as $H \\leq \\mathbb{G}$. The order of a subgroup always divides the order of the group (Lagrange's Theorem). Similar to a set, every group $\\mathbb{G} \\subseteq \\mathbb{G}$, and for every group there is a trivial subgroup containing only the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms\n",
    "\n",
    "A function $f: G \\to H$ between groups is a homomorphism if it preserves the group operation: $f(ab) = f(a)f(b) \\forall a,b \\in G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An isomorphism is a bijective homomorphism. If there exists an isomorphism between groups $G$ and $H$, we say they are isomorphic and write $G \\cong H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cosets and Normal Subgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "For a subgroup $H$ of $G$ and an element $a \\in G$, we define:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Left coset: $aH = \\{ah : h \\in H\\}$\n",
    "- Right coset: $Ha = \\{ha : h \\in H\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A subgroup $N$ of $G$ is called normal if $gN = Ng \\forall g \\in G$. We denote this as $$N \\triangleleft G$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cyclic Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "A group $\\mathbb{G}$ is cyclic if there exists an element $g \\in \\mathbb{G}$ such that every element of $\\mathbb{G}$ can be written as a power of $g$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{G} = \\langle g \\rangle = \\{g^n : n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $g$ is called a generator of $\\mathbb{G}$. Cyclic groups have several important properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every element $x \\in \\mathbb{G}$ can be written as $x = g^n$ for some integer $n$.\n",
    "2. If $\\mathbb{G}$ is infinite, it is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}, +)$.\n",
    "3. If $\\mathbb{G}$ is finite with $|\\mathbb{G}| = n$, it is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}, +)$.\n",
    "4. All cyclic groups are Abelian.\n",
    "5. Subgroups of cyclic groups are cyclic.\n",
    "6. The order of $\\mathbb{G}$ is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $g^m = e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quotient Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "If $N \\triangleleft G$, we can form the quotient group $G/N$, whose elements are the cosets of $N$ in $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ring Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "A ring $(R, +, \\cdot)$ is an algebraic structure consisting of a set $R$ with two binary operations, addition $(+)$ and multiplication $(\\cdot)$, satisfying the following axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $(R, +)$ is an abelian group:\n",
    "   - Closure: $\\forall a, b \\in R, a + b \\in R$\n",
    "   - Associativity: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$\n",
    "   - Commutativity: $\\forall a, b \\in R, a + b = b + a$\n",
    "   - Identity: $\\exists 0 \\in R, \\forall a \\in R, a + 0 = 0 + a = a$\n",
    "   - Inverse: $\\forall a \\in R, \\exists (-a) \\in R, a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $(R, \\cdot)$ is a monoid:\n",
    "   - Closure: $\\forall a, b \\in R, a \\cdot b \\in R$\n",
    "   - Associativity: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R, (a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distributivity:\n",
    "   - Left distributivity: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R, a \\cdot (b + c) = (a \\cdot b) + (a \\cdot c)$\n",
    "   - Right distributivity: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R, (a + b) \\cdot c = (a \\cdot c) + (b \\cdot c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "A ring is called commutative if multiplication is commutative, i.e., $\\forall a, b \\in R, a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a$. If a ring has a multiplicative identity element $1 \\neq 0$ such that $\\forall a \\in R, 1 \\cdot a = a \\cdot 1 = a$, it is called a ring with unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideals\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal of a ring $R$ is a subset $I \\subseteq R$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $(I,+)$ is a subgroup of $(R,+)$, meaning:\n",
    "   a. $I$ is non-empty\n",
    "   b. For all $a,b \\in I$, $a - b \\in I$\n",
    "2. For all $r \\in R$ and $i \\in I$, both $r \\cdot i \\in I$ and $i \\cdot r \\in I$ (absorption property)\n",
    "\n",
    "The absorption property of ideals interacts with both ring operations, as it involves multiplication by any ring element and the result remains in the ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quotient Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "For a ring $R$ and ideal $I$, the quotient ring $R/I$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R/I = \\{r + I : r \\in R\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r + I = \\{r + i : i \\in I\\}$ is the coset of $r$ modulo $I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations in $R/I$ are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Addition: $(a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I$\n",
    "2. Multiplication: $(a + I) \\cdot (b + I) = (a \\cdot b) + I$\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are well-defined because of the ideal properties, particularly the absorption property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polynomial Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a ring $R$, the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is defined as the set of all formal sums of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ... + a_nx^n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $n \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$\n",
    "2. $a_i \\in R$ (called coefficients)\n",
    "3. $x$ is an indeterminate (or variable)\n",
    "4. Only finitely many $a_i$ are non-zero\n",
    "\n",
    "The ring structure of $R[x]$ is defined by the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Addition: For $f(x) = \\sum a_ix^i$ and $g(x) = \\sum b_ix^i$,\n",
    "\n",
    "   $(f + g)(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\max(\\deg(f),\\deg(g))} (a_i + b_i)x^i$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiplication: For $f(x) = \\sum a_ix^i$$ and $$g(x) = \\sum b_ix^i$,\n",
    "\n",
    "   $(f \\cdot g)(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\deg(f)+\\deg(g)} (\\sum_{i+j=k} a_ib_j)x^k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The zero polynomial, denoted $0$, has all coefficients equal to $0$.\n",
    "2. If $R$ has a unity $1 \\neq 0$, then $R[x]$ has a unity, which is the constant polynomial $1$.\n",
    "3. $R$ is embedded in $R[x]$ as the set of constant polynomials.\n",
    "4. If $R$ is commutative, then $R[x]$ is commutative.\n",
    "5. The degree of a non-zero polynomial $f(x)$, denoted $\\deg(f)$, is the highest power of $x$ with a non-zero coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition treats polynomials as formal algebraic objects, not as functions. The construction can be extended to multiple variables, e.g., $R[x,y] = (R[x])[y]$."
