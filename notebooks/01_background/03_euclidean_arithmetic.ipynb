    "### Prime Numbers and Divisibility\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely represented as a product of prime powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For integers $a$ and $b$, we say $a$ divides $b$ (denoted $a \\mid b$) if there exists an integer $k$ such that $b = ak$. If $a \\mid b$ and $a \\mid c$, then $a \\mid (bx + cy)$ for any integers $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)\n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest common divisor of two integers $a$ and $b$, denoted $\\gcd(a,b)$, is the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and $b$. Key properties include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(|a|,|b|)$\n",
    "2. $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(b, a \\bmod b)$ (basis for the Euclidean algorithm)\n",
    "3. There exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $\\gcd(a,b) = ax + by$ (Bézout's identity)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integral Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity that has no zero divisors. In other words, for all non-zero elements $a, b \\in R$, if $a \\cdot b = 0$, then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. This property is crucial as it allows for cancellation in multiplication: if $a \\cdot b = a \\cdot c$ and $a \\neq 0$, then $b = c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclidean Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "A Euclidean domain is an integral domain $R$ equipped with a function $\\delta: R \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}$ (called the Euclidean function) satisfying:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For all non-zero $a, b \\in R$, $\\delta(a) \\leq \\delta(ab)$\n",
    "2. For all $a, b \\in R$ with $b \\neq 0$, there exist $q, r \\in R$ such that $a = bq + r$ and either $r = 0$ or $\\delta(r) < \\delta(b)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second property is known as the Euclidean division algorithm, which is a generalization of the division algorithm for integers. This algorithm allows us to perform division with remainders in the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Euclidean Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ with $\\delta(a) = |a|$\n",
    "2. The polynomial ring $F[x]$ over a field $F$ with $\\delta(p) = \\deg(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclidean Division\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean division is the process of dividing one integer by another to produce a quotient and a remainder. In the context of modular arithmetic, we're particularly interested in the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For integers $a$ and $b$ with $b \\neq 0$, there exist unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$a = bq + r$, where $0 \\leq r < |b|$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Euclidean Division Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a pseudocode algorithm for Euclidean division:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function euclidean_division(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        error \"Division by zero\"\n",
    "    q = floor(a / b)\n",
    "    r = a - b * q\n",
    "    if r < 0:\n",
    "        if b > 0:\n",
    "            q = q - 1\n",
    "            r = r + b\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            q = q + 1\n",
    "            r = r - b\n",
    "    return (q, r)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In $\\mathbb{Z}_5$, we're primarily concerned with the remainder $r$, which will always be in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extended Euclidean Division\n",
    "\n",
    "The extended Euclidean Division is a way to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers $a$ and $b$, and also find the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\gcd(a,b) = ax + by$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some integers $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extended Euclidean Division Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function extended_euclidean_division(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        return (a, 1, 0)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        (gcd, x', y') = extended_gcd(b, a mod b)\n",
    "        x = y'\n",
    "        y = x' - floor(a / b) * y'\n",
    "        return (gcd, x, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm not only computes the GCD but also finds the coefficients $x$ and $y$ in Bézout's identity."
