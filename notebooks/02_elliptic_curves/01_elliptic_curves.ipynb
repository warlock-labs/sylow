    "## Elliptic Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition and Basic Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "An elliptic curve $E$ over a field $K$ is a smooth, projective algebraic curve of genus one, with a specified point $O$. In characteristic not 2 or 3, every elliptic curve can be written in short Weierstrass form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a, b \\in K$, and the discriminant $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) \\neq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Point at Infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "The point $O$, called the point at infinity, serves as the identity element for the group law. In projective coordinates, it can be represented as $[0:1:0]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Affine and Projective Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Affine form: $E = \\{(x,y) \\in K^2 : y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\\} \\cup \\{O\\}$\n",
    "- Projective form: $E = \\{[X:Y:Z] \\in \\mathbb{P}^2(K) : Y^2Z = X^3 + aXZ^2 + bZ^3\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Elliptic curves have an abelian group structure, with the point at infinity $O$ serving as the identity element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geometric Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "For points $P, Q$ on $E$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $O + P = P$ for all $P$\n",
    "2. If $P = (x, y)$, then $P + (x, -y) = O$ (inverse)\n",
    "3. To add $P$ and $Q$ (chord rule):\n",
    "   - Draw a line through $P$ and $Q$\n",
    "   - Find the third intersection point $R$ with $E$\n",
    "   - Reflect $R$ across the x-axis to get $P + Q$\n",
    "4. To double $P$ (tangent rule):\n",
    "   - Draw the tangent line to $E$ at $P$\n",
    "   - Find the second intersection point $R$ with $E$\n",
    "   - Reflect $R$ across the x-axis to get $2P$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algebraic Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "For $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, $P_3 = (x_3, y_3) = P_1 + P_2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $P_1 \\neq P_2$:\n",
    "$x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2$\n",
    "$y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$\n",
    "where $\\lambda = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $P_1 = P_2$:\n",
    "$x_3 = \\lambda^2 - 2x_1$\n",
    "$y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$\n",
    "where $\\lambda = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalar Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "For a point $P$ on $E$ and an integer $n$, scalar multiplication $[n]P$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[n]P = \\underbrace{P + P + \\cdots + P}_{n \\text{ times}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is fundamental in elliptic curve cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Double-and-Add Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "An efficient method to compute $[n]P$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert $n$ to binary: $n = \\sum_{i=0}^k b_i 2^i$\n",
    "2. Initialize $Q = O$\n",
    "3. For $i$ from $k$ down to 0:\n",
    "   - $Q = 2Q$\n",
    "   - If $b_i = 1$, $Q = Q + P$\n",
    "4. Return $Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elliptic Curves over Finite Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "When the field $K$ is finite (typically $\\mathbb{F}_p$ or $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$), the elliptic curve $E(K)$ forms a finite abelian group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Order of the Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of points on $E(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, denoted $\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, satisfies the Hasse bound:\n",
    "\n",
    "$q + 1 - 2\\sqrt{q} \\leq \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\leq q + 1 + 2\\sqrt{q}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "For an elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_1 | n_2$ and $n_1 | q - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pairings\n",
    "\n",
    "Bilinear pairings on elliptic curves are crucial for many advanced cryptographic protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weil Pairing\n",
    "\n",
    "For an elliptic curve $E$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and a prime $l | \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, the Weil pairing is a map:\n",
    "\n",
    "$e: E[l] \\times E[l] \\to \\mu_l$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E[l]$ is the $l$-torsion subgroup and $\\mu_l$ is the group of $l$-th roots of unity in $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties:\n",
    "1. Bilinearity: $e([a]P, [b]Q) = e(P,Q)^{ab}$\n",
    "2. Non-degeneracy: If $e(P,Q) = 1$ for all $Q \\in E[l]$, then $P = O$\n",
    "3. Alternating: $e(P,P) = 1$ for all $P \\in E[l]$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tate Pairing\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduced Tate pairing is a more efficient alternative to the Weil pairing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$t: E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k})[l] \\times E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k})/lE(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}) \\to \\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^*/{(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^*)}^l$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is the embedding degree.\n",
