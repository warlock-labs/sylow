    "I think it's worth while to go over how pairing works in reality, since `MMM` doesn't do a practical dive into this, short of saying that $\\mathbb{G}_2\\subset \\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$ in our case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Embedding degree\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we dealing with $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$ at all? Well, we're technically dealing with not the entire EC group, but the cyclic subgroup $\\langle X\\rangle$ generated by the point $X$ which is the base of our DL problem (ie $X^d\\equiv Y\\implies [d]X = Y$). The embedding process (aka taking points from $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and map them into $\\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$) is done by the pairing $e(x, y)$ which, for a point $x$ in the n-order subgroup of the curve, will be an n-th root of unity for some $y$, required by the condition that $e(ax, by)=e(x,y)^{ab}$. In order for this to hold, there must be enough roots of unity in the field, which happens when $p^k\\equiv 1\\mod \\ell$, where $\\ell$ is the order of the cyclic subgroup. For us, this is $k=12$, so the embedding must go from the curve to $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to deal with this massive extension for the pairing operation because the curve defined over this extension is the smallest extension which contains subgroups of order $r$ that we can use for pairings, one subgroup in which contains only points with zero trace, which we choose to be $\\mathbb{G}_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have $\\mathbb{G}_1\\subset E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ with $|\\mathbb{G}_1|=r$, and $\\mathbb{G}_2\\subset E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})$ with $|\\mathbb{G}_2|=r$ which we want to use for our pairing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an irreducible polynomial $N \\in \\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ of degree $m=12$, the elements of this extension are those given by $\\{a_{m-1}x^{m-1}+\\cdots+a_1x+a_0 \\,|\\, a_i\\in \\mathbb{F}_p\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication is defined by multiplying the two polynomials, then using polynomial long division on the polynomial $N$ to get the remainder, and inverses are defined via the extended euclidean algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can \"tower\" extensions if the order of one divides the order of the other, so if $m_j | m_{j+1}$, then $\\mathbb{F}_p \\subset \\mathbb{F}_{p^{m_1}}\\subset\\cdots\\subset \\mathbb{F}_{p^{m_k}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [standard tower](https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/354.pdf) for BN254 is given by the following (see [here](https://github.com/ethereum/py_pairing/blob/master/py_ecc/bn128/bn128_field_elements.py) or [here](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra/tree/master/curves/bn254/src/fields)):\n",

    "\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}&=\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}[w]/(w^2-v)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\beta$ is a quadratic nonresidue in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\\xi$ neither a quadratic or cubic residue in $\\mathbb{F_{p^2}}$, which amounts to saying that $X^6-\\xi$ is irreducible in the ring $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}[X]$. Here, $\\beta=-1,\\xi=9+u$, which brings about $u^2=-1, w^2=v, v^3=9+u$, and therefore:\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}} = \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}[w]/(w^6-(9+u))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings about the following nice points\n",
    "- any element in this extension can be written as $g+hw$ with $g,h\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}$, which means that the $p^6$-th power of any element in the extension $x^{p^6}=g-hw$ is free to compute\n",
    "- Likewise writing each $g,h$ in terms of coefficients from $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ lets you compute the $p$-th, $p^2$-th, and $p^3$-th powers easily as well\n",

    "## Twists\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with elements directly in $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$ is very unruly and inefficient, but it is possible to define a coordinate transformation such that such that the curve in the 12-th order extension is mapped to a lower degree field. \n",
    "\n",
    "For BN254, we define a sextic twist (aka drops the degree of extension by 6) such that the twisted curve is defined on $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ instead of $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$. Defining $u^6=(1+i)^{-1}$, the twist performs $(x,y)\\to(x/u^2,y/u^3)$ to produce our new curve $E^\\prime(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y'^2 = x'^3 + \\frac{3}{9+i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Very nice. Note though that points in $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ are pairs of ints, while points on the twist are pairs of complex ints, so points in $\\mathbb{G}_2$ take more storage despite them being also valid as the domain for keys and signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [this](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-197) for industry definition of this twist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $X^6-\\xi$ is irreducible, with roots $w\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$, we therefore have a homomorphism\n",
    "$$\\Psi:E^\\prime(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})\\to E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})\\,;\\,(x',y') = (w^2x', w^3y')$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is injective, but not surjective, and defines the twist mapping!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need one more thing before we talk about pairings. This is a bit technical (I know right, something in this document being technical? pshhaw), and is closely related to concepts from Galois theory which is above the scope of this review, but suffice to say you can define an *algrebraic closure* $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_p$, which is the field where every non-constant polynomial with coefficients in the field has a root in the field, which we can think about as the union of all valid extensions $\\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. Defining a curve over the algebraic closure is a concise way to say that we're interested in points lying in $\\mathbb{F}_p, \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}, \\mathbb{F}_{p^6}, \\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$ that satisfy the curve equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a mapping $\\phi_p:E(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_p)\\to E(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_p); (x,y)\\to(x^p,y^p)$ called the Frobenius morphism. It can [can be shown](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-09494-6) that the set of points fixed by $\\phi$ are *exactly* the finite group $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, so application of this mapping to the curve defined on the base field will leave things structurally unchanged. This mapping will crop back up later in our definition of optimal ate pairing.\n",

    "## G1, G2\n",

    "Now actually having the field extension primer, we can talk about what exactly $\\mathbb{G}_1,\\mathbb{G}_2$ are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the $r$-torsion points of a curve are all the points $X$ such that $rX=\\mathcal{O}$, with $\\mathcal{O}$ the point at infinity. Ie, these are all points of order dividing r. We therefore define\n",

    "\n",
    "In our scheme, to hash a message to $E$, we use `hash_to_field` and `field_to_curve`, and then multiply the mapped curve point by the generator of the curve to create a point in $\\mathbb{G}_1$. Fortunately, by [Theorem 2.3.1 of Silverman](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-09494-6), we have \n",
    "$$ |E(\\mathbb{F}_p)|=p+1-t$$\n",
    "and for BN curves generated by a value $z=2^{62}-2^{54}+2^{44}$, we have $p(z)+1-t(z)=r(z)$, implying that $|E(\\mathbb{F}_p)|=r\\implies \\mathbb{G}_1 = E(\\mathbb{F}_p)[r]=E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$!\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore only need to check if a pair $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{F}_r\\times\\mathbb{F}_r$ is on the curve $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ for membership in $\\mathbb{G}_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### G2\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bit trickier. You can check easily if the point $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}\\times\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ lies on $E^\\prime(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})$, but unfortunately the order of the twist curve is not given by the order of the $r$-torsion, ie $|E^\\prime(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})|=c_2r$, where $c_2$ is the $\\mathbb{G}_2$ cofactor. [You can show](https://hackmd.io/@jpw/bn254#mathbb-G_2-order) that $c_2=p+t-1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can just rely on the definition of the $r$-torsion if you want to check if $[r](x,y)=\\mathcal{O}$, but with 254 bits of r, this is slooooooow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster algorithms exist. For instance, defined the untwist-Frobenius-twist endomorphism of [Galbraith-Scott](https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/117.pdf):\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\Psi$ is the twist mapping, and recall $\\xi=9+u$. Membership in $\\mathbb{G}_2$ therefore [boils down to verifying](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/352.pdf) if the following holds: $Q=(x^\\prime, y^\\prime); \\psi(Q)=[6x^2]Q$, and [more recent work](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/348.pdf) improves this to the following:\n",

    "finally, we're here!! fuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our goal here is to take a point $X\\in\\mathbb{G}_1= E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, and a point $Y\\in\\mathbb{G}_2\\subset E^\\prime(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})$, and map them to a point in a target group $\\mathbb{G}_T\\subset\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$, denoted by the map $e$, and corresponds qualitatively to multiplying a point in $\\mathbb{G}_1$ by a point in $\\mathbb{G}_2$. \n",
