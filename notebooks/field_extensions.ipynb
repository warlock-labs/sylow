    "Why are we dealing with $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$ at all? Well, we're technically dealing with not the entire EC group, but the cyclic subgroup $\\langle X\\rangle$ generated by the point $X$ which is the base of our DL problem (ie $X^d\\equiv Y\\implies [d]X = Y$). The embedding process (aka taking points from $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and map them into $\\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$) is done by the pairing $e(x, y)$ which, for a point $x$ in the n-order subgroup of the curve, will be an n-th root of unity for some $y$, required by the condition that $e(ax, by)=e(x,y)^{ab}$. In order for this to hold, there must be enough roots of unity in the field, which happens when $p^k\\equiv 1\\mod \\ell$, where $\\ell$ is the order of the cyclic subgroup. For us, this is $k=12$, so the embedding must go from the curve to $\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$. \n",

    "We need to deal with this massive extension for the pairing operation because the curve defined over this extension is the smallest extension which contains subgroups of order $r$ that we can use for pairings, one subgroup in which contains only points with zero trace, which we choose to be $\\mathbb{G}_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have $\\mathbb{G}_1\\subset E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ with $|\\mathbb{G}_1|=r$, and $\\mathbb{G}_2\\subset E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})$ with $|\\mathbb{G}_2|=r$ which we want to use for our pairing.\n",

This is a bit technical (I know right, something in this document being technical? pshhaw), and is closely related to concepts from Galois theory which is above the scope of this review, but suffice to say you can define an *algrebraic closure* $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_p$, which is the field where every non-constant polynomial with coefficients in the field has a root in the field, which we can think about as the union of all valid extensions $\\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. Defining a curve over the algebraic closure is a concise way to say that we're interested in points lying in $\\mathbb{F}_p, \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}, \\mathbb{F}_{p^6}, \\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}$ that satisfy the curve equation. \n",

In this way, since $r$-torsions give us some notion of structure, this means that the \"prime factorization\" of the curve is simply the curve itself, so its smallest possible prime order subgroup is just the group, no extra structure to be found.\n",

[You can show](https://hackmd.io/@jpw/bn254#mathbb-G_2-order) that $c_2=p+t-1$. Thinking about $r$-torsions as structure again, it makes sense that this is the case even just from the consideration of the total number of elements in the preimage of $\\mathbb{G}_2$ ($\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}\\times\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$) vs $\\mathbb{G}_1$ ($\\mathbb{F}_p$); with that many more elements to consider, it makes sense that there is additional structure in the group to now deal with. \n",

Why the roots o f unity? Great question. Remember that this mapping has to satisfy a few key real-world properties. First, it has to be a trapdoor, namely preimage resistance (assuming DL hardness), and mapping backwards from the roots of unity is a very difficult problem. Second, it allows for an easy metric against which we can compare two mappings. For example, in the case of signature verification $e(\\sigma_i, g_2)=e(H(m), P(i))$, it is very natural to want to set the actual value of each side of this equation to \"one\", therefore implying the image domain to be the roots of unity. \n",
