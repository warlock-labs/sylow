<!-- Generally seems to be pronounced SEE-low at least in American English, and perhaps note that it's being named after Ludwig. -->
Sylow (*ÀàsyÀêl…îv*) is a comprehensive Rust library for elliptic curve cryptography, specifically tailored for the BN254 (
alt-bn128) curve. It provides a robust implementation of finite fields, elliptic curve groups, and pairing-based
cryptography, making it an ideal choice for applications in blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, and other cryptographic
systems.

## Features

- **Finite Field Arithmetic**: Efficient implementations of prime fields and their extensions ùîΩ‚Çö, ùîΩ‚Çö¬≤, ùîΩ‚Çö‚Å∂, ùîΩ‚Çö¬π¬≤
- **Elliptic Curve Groups**: Complete support for operations on ùîæ‚ÇÅ, ùîæ‚ÇÇ, and ùîæ‚Çú groups of the BN254 curve
- **Pairing Operations**: Optimized implementation of the optimal ate pairing
- **Cryptographic Primitives**:
    - Key generation
    - BLS signature generation and verification
    - Hash-to-curve functionality
- **Compatibility**: Designed to be compatible with Ethereum's precompiled
  contracts for BN254 operations and [Warlock](https://warlock.xyz/)'s
  [SolBLS](https://github.com/warlock-labs/solbls) library.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sylow = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example demonstrating key generation, signing, and verification:

```rust
use sylow::{KeyPair, sign, verify};

fn main() {
    // Generate a new key pair
    let key_pair = KeyPair::generate();

    // Message to be signed
    let message = b"Hello, Sylow!";

    // Sign the message
    match sign(&key_pair.secret_key, message) {
        Ok(signature) => {
            // Verify the signature
            match verify(&key_pair.public_key, message, &signature) {
                Ok(is_valid) => {
                    assert!(is_valid, "Signature verification failed");
                    println!("Signature verified successfully!");
                }
                Err(e) => println!("Verification error: {:?}", e),
            }
        }
        Err(e) => println!("Signing error: {:?}", e),
    }
}
```

## Core Concepts

- **Finite fields**: The foundation of the library, providing arithmetic operations in prime fields and their
  extensions.
- **Elliptic Curve Groups**: Implementations of the ùîæ‚ÇÅ, ùîæ‚ÇÇ, and ùîæ‚Çú groups on the BN254 curve, supporting both affine and
  projective coordinates.
- **Pairing**: Efficient implementation of the optimal ate pairing, crucial for many cryptographic protocols.
- **alt-bn128 (BN254) Curve**: A pairing-friendly elliptic curve widely used in zkSNARKs and supported by Ethereum
  precompiles.

## Advanced Features

- **Customizable Hashing**: Supports various hash functions through the `Expander` trait, such as the XMD and XOF
  algorithms on any hasher from [sha3](https://github.com/RustCrypto/hashes/tree/master/sha3).
- **Optimized Arithmetic**: Utilizes Montgomery form for efficient modular arithmetic.
- **Constant-time Operations**: Implements algorithms resistant to timing attacks.
- **Batch Verification**: Verify multiple signatures in a single operation for improved performance.

## Performance

Sylow is designed with performance in mind, leveraging optimized algorithms for j-invariant zero curves, the optimal ate
pairing for efficient signature verification, as well as multiprecision Montgomery arithmetic.

## Security

Sylow is designed in compliance with the recommendations set forth by Cloudflare
in [RFC 9380](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9380), especially regarding hashing an arbitrary byte array to an
element of the curve. We provide multiple secure implementations of the `hash_to_field` standard and implement the
Shallue-van de Woestijne encoding for elliptic curve points.

The multiprecision arithmetic operations are implemented in constant time, ensuring resistance to side-channel attacks.
Constant-time operations are used whenever possible, and there are currently no variable-time functions used in Sylow.

If you discover any security issues, please report them to [team@warlock.xyz](mailto:team@warlock.xyz).
